# Introduction presentation slide 22:
How did we record the information to make the pictures ?
Information is contained in the 'step' as delta information of a particle. This
information can be taken through 'hooks' which a user need to apply themselves.
Then the information can be used to make pictures. But this is inconvenient?
The Auxiliary part of the essential elements of Geant4 contains visualisation
and recordings of user requested information.
There's also the Trajectory and TrajectoryPoint, which contain information
about the path (well... trajectory) of the particle.
However, Geant4 does the physics 'silently' meaning that you need to ask
for the relevant information. The three ways are explained in the presentation,
I'm not going to copy them here. 

How did we create the initial tracks ?
An event occurs and creates a number of tracks. The initial track is created att
the beginning of an event from which other tracks are spawned. It is mandatory
to generate a primary event through the G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction which
spawns the initial tracks.

What types of particles can be simulated by Geant4 ?
Geant4 can simulate these partiles:

which are leptons, baryons, mesons and therefore hadrons and fermions.

How did we create the geometry we saw ?
Not sure? There was a part about how random points are distributed on a
sphere. 

### Week4 Assignment ###
# 3. Are you missing something in the main() listing given the above
presentations?
In the main() the "mandatory" user initialization classes are missing.

# 4. What is the distinction between Physical and Logical Volumes? 
You create a physical volume starting with your logical volume. A physical
volume is simply a placed instance of the logical volume. This instance must be
placed inside a mother logical volume. 

One logical volume multiple physical volumes

# 4. how is the detector defined?
The detector is defined as a new instance of a YourDetectorConstruction class
which is defined in YourDetectorConstruction.cc and YourDetectorConstruction.hh
# 4. What do you get when you try to do ‘/run/beamOn 1’? Why?
We get an error saying that "G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction is not defined!".
Since this is not defined, no events can be created.

# 5. Inspect the four new files. What do you notice?
I notice for each class there is a header file ".hh" and a c++ file ".cc" in
'/include' and '/src' respectively. The new files are to represent the
YourPrimaryGeneratorAction and the YourActionInitialization classes. Both
classes are of the mandatory classes for a Geant4 setup.
# 5. Compare ProgC/ourmain.cc with ProgB/ourmain.cc what lines do you need to
add to properly register YourActionInitialization ?
The part under "Create your action initialization and register in the
Run-Manager" is not included in the ourmain.cc of ProgB. However, the 
YourPrimaryGeneratorAction has not been used in the ourmain.cc of ProgC either.
# 5. Change the particle to a proton and run an event-what is the outcome?
The geantino is the default particle. This will be set to proton with
"/gun/particle proton".
First of all, the proton trajectory is in blue. The proton's path is pretty
straight with only a slight bend. Only rarely does the proton change direction
when it reaches the center of the sphere.
# 5. Change the particle to a positron and run an event-what is the outcome?
 The electron seems to have a less stable path of flight and its path bends
a lot more. Reaching the center of the sphere almost always results in a sharp
angle in its path. The electron's path is displayed in red.
A positron acts a bit differently, upon reaching the center of the sphere
it usually turns right back around ("makes an 180 degree angle"). 

Both proton and positron are displayed in blue and the electron is displayed in
red. This implies that blue corresponds to a positively charged particle and
red to a negatively charged particle. From the proton and positron a particle
can spawn with a green path. For the positron, very rarely a particle spawns
with a red path. Is green a neutrally charged particle?
