### Assignment 2 ###
# What is the default particle and energy?
The default particle is one e- (G4Electron::Definition()).
The partile has an energy of 30MeV (30.0*CLHEP::MeV).
It has the default direction of 1.0, 0.0, 0.0.

Thread-local: read and written only by the same thread.


### Assignment 3 ###
Choose a physics list, based on kind of applications; BERT FTFP, etc.

Lookup tables, how do they work?

the example uses test37

Open test37 with Stat Comparison simply shows the graph of the test. How
do you compare this?


### Assignment 4 ###
Scoring:
    - use built-in commands: preferred, for all common physics quantities
    - user scorers in tracking volume: create scores for each event, create own Run class
    - use G4SensitiveDetector: use user hooks
