### What are the decay levels & decay energies? What is the half-life? ###

For Co60 three decay cahins are available.
For Co60 to Co60, there are two decay levels shown: 58.6 MeV and 0.0 eV. The
decay time from level 58.6 MeV to 0.0 eV is 5.2712 years. The half-life time
(I would assume) is 10.467 M (mega seconds?).

For dataset 3 where Co60 decays to Ni60, there are more decay levels. The most
intense decays are for the XR kbeta3 processes with the two lines of
1173.228 (3) & 1332.492 (4) keV being the most intense. Here the decay time
is 1925.28 days, which is about 5.3 years.


### Can you find back the gamma rays from what you found in the
leveldescription? In particularthe lines below < 1 MeV? ###

The result of the histogram when executing: f.FindObjectAny("3")->Draw(); 
shows that there are about 200k entries with a mean energy of 1253 keV and a
standard deviation of 79.85 keV for gamma rays. Most notably, there are
only two regions containing the data. One around 1173 keV and the other around
1332 keV. 

When looking at the description from 
https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/dec_searchi.jsp we find that the data in the
histogram corresponds to the two most intense XR kbeta3 radiation decay levels
found in Dataset 3 for Co60 to Ni60: 1173.228 (3) & 1332.492 (4) keV. However,
these lines are both still above 1 MeV.

Setting the x-range to go from 0 to 1 MeV reveals two new prominent lines around
350 and 820 keV. These lines correspond to the 3rd and 4th intense lines of the
XR kbeta 3 radiation. Changing the x-range and trying to find the other
lines yields no results for XR 1, kalpha2 or kbeta1 radiation.

Therefore, I conclude that his histogram is filled only with entries of XR
kbeta3 in the range of about 347.14 to 1332.492 keV (with some deviations).


### Use the Fitpanel (go to “Tools”->“Fit Panel”) to fit the life time of Co60.
How does this compare the half-life? ###

Fitting an exponential line to the total time of life of decay chain histogram
gives a nicely fitted line through the data poitns. Changing the x-range
I can give an estimation for the half-life time. The half life, as I can tell
from the fit, is in fact around the 5 year mark.

Half life, use the slope! there is a formula with the natural logarithm
