###

measure momentum of particles
calorimeter for energy of electrons and photons
calorimeter for hadrons
time of flights hodoscopes?
tof + momentum ---gives--> particle mass

in tree: for every entry there is a seperate event
with a given energy
respond to various detectors
now have full correlation -> start looking at hodoscope one, how does it correlate
with EM calorimeter

store corelation between data sets/histograms and such

page3 simple jupyter notebook, uses pyroot, accesses information in the tree

change axis: use th2f object
matplotlib and root stuff don't interact!
matplotlib line in jupyter notebook is to let the notebook know there will be
drawn graphs
